ai-agent-backend/database_schema.sql
```

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
# Backend (terminal 1)
cd ai-agent-backend
.\gradlew.bat bootRun

# Frontend (terminal 2)
cd ai-agent-frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Generate a Weekly Plan
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/weekly-plan
2. Click **"Generate AI Plan"** button
3. The AI will create a customized week-long training plan

## 🤖 AI Generation Logic

The AI creates plans that:

1. **Target different muscle groups:**
   - Upper body (chest, back, shoulders, arms)
   - Lower body (legs, glutes)
   - Core
   - Cardio

2. **Ensure proper rest:**
   - 24-48 hours between similar muscle groups
   - Includes 1-2 full rest days per week
   - Alternates high and low intensity

3. **Consider equipment:**
   - Uses equipment from the database knowledge base
   - Provides alternatives when needed
   - Adapts to available resources

4. **Progressive difficulty:**
   - Starts appropriate for user level
   - Balances strength and cardio
   - Includes variety to prevent boredom
